# Histograms

Use the [chart editor](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63824?hl=en) in Google Sheets to create [histograms](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9146867). 

In Google Sheets, the default histogram is *not* drawn with a density scale. Instead, the height of a block reflects the absolute frequency of data points in the corresponding class interval. 

The width of all class intervals is equal in Google Sheets and can be customized using the "Bucket Size" option in the chart editor (Customize$\rightarrow$Histogram). {cite}`freedman2007statistics` draws a distinction between block height and block area, but with equal interval widths, a taller block will also have a greater area. 

Google's [histogram documentation](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9146867) includes examples showing the customization options.
