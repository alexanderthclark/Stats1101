# Welcome to Intro Stats

```{important}
These notes are not entirely self-contained. They should be read in companion with the primary text, {cite}`freedman2007statistics`, and other readings.
```

These notes are based primarily on the textbook, {cite}`freedman2007statistics`, following the organization of content and the notation. The textbook and other readings are the real authorities on the material, but these notes can help direct you through what is important for the course. The course largely follows the textbook, but a few chapters are skipped and I add these topics.

1. Natural experiments
2. A brief mention of exploratory data analysis
3. Bayes' Theorem and probability trees
4. Power and false discovery rate
5. Multiple linear regression (if time allows)

Sections marked "Extension" go beyond the book's treatment of a subject. These sections are meant to help test your comfort with the ideas, either developing a deeper understanding (e.g., Section TKTK) or broadening the context (e.g., Section TKTK).

The provided exercises supplement the exercises in {cite}`freedman2007statistics`. Use the textbook exercises to drill the concepts before attempting the exercises here.

We'll argue that statistics is *not* just math, but the imperative from Halmos still applies.
