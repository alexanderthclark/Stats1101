## Scatter Plots

The relationship between two quantitative variables can be explored in a scatter plot. 
You need data that is paired, like in the father and son data below. Each $x,y$ pair is plotted and you might notice a trend from the shape of the scatter of points.

```{list-table} Father and Son Height Data
:header-rows: 1
:widths: auto

* - Father's Height (inches)
  - Son's Height (inches)
* - 65.0
  - 59.8
* - 63.3
  - 63.2
* - 65.0
  - 63.3
```

The relationship is called an **association**. When the scatter of points slopes upward, that shows a positive association. If the scatter slopes downward, that shows a negative association. A strong association indicates that one variable can be used to predict the others.

There is a positive association between a father's height and his son's height. The orange points are for the three pairs shown in the table above.  
```


The variable on the $x$-axis is thought of as the **independent variable** and the $y$-axis variable is the **dependent variable**. This language suggests that the $x$ variable is the one influencing the $y$, as if there's a direction of causality being hypothesized. In this class, we have learned to be cautious in claiming causality. Go ahead and choose one variable as the independent variable and the other as the dependent without too much angst or hesitation. Just be ready to be humbled if you ultimately find the there is no causal relationship or if you get the direction backwards. 


For each of these two pairs, which variable would you choose as the independent variable? 

1. Hours of sleep and test performance on the following day
2. Welfare spending and poverty
3. Attractiveness and income


```{dropdown} Sleep and test performance

Sleep should be the independent variable, especially given the temporal precedence.

```

```{dropdown} Welfare spending and poverty 

Either choice is justified, or maybe neither is justified if you are too insistent. Statistician Udny Yule considered spending on public assistance as the independent variable and poverty as the dependent variable in his "investigation into the causes of changes in pauperism in England" ({cite}`yule1899investigation`). This makes sense if you insist that assistance only increases dependence on help. But it's obviously wrong if assistance can help break cycles of poverty. 

```

```{dropdown} Attractiveness and income


Either choice is justified. {cite}`monk2021beholding` considers attractiveness as the independent variable and earnings as the dependent variable in examining the "returns to physical attractiveness." However, as the figure below suggests, the effect can go both ways.

## Correlation Coefficient

The correlation coefficient is a measure of linear association, or clustering around a line.
The coefficient falls between -1 and 1.
