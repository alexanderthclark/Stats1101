    "## Type I and II Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Type I error** is made by rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true. A **Type II Error** is made when failing to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false. While some mistakes, like snooping, are a matter of bad practice and can be avoided, Type I and II errors are unavoidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing involves a binary decision. If we compare this to the deliberations of a judge, it is the null hypothesis that is on trial. Rejecting the hypothesis is akin to judging it to be guilty. Failing to reject the null hypothesis is akin to acquitting it, and this might be considered a negative result. This corresponds to the taxonomy in the table below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the judicial analogy, a Type I error is convicting the true, innocent null hypothesis. A Type II error lets the false, crooked null hypothesis off the hook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians use $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ to denote the Type I and II conditional error rates. I call them *conditional* error rates to emphasize that each is a conditional probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{reject }H_0 \\mid H_0\\text{ true})$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$\\beta = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{fail to reject }H_0 \\mid H_0\\text{ false})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $\\alpha$ is familiar, being directly related to the confidence level. A test has an associated **power** level, $1-\\beta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Power\n",
    "\n",
    "The **power** of a test is the probability it will reject the null hypothesis if the null is false. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given statistical test, the power depends on the significance level $\\alpha$ and the sample size $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the significance $\\alpha$ influences the power because you are determining how liberal or conservative to be with rejecting the null. A high $\\alpha$ means you will reject the null more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Suppose you wanted 95% power in the illustration above ($\\beta = 0.05$). According to the null hypothesis, a $z$-statistic will be drawn from a standard normal distribution (the top panel). We simplify the world to consider a single alternative hypothesis, under which the $z$-statistic is actually drawn from a distribution centered at two. To force $\\beta = 0.05$, the vertical line must be 1.645 standard deviations away from the mean of the alternative distribution. Accordingly our critical value is $z^\\star = 2-1.645 = 0.355$. A $z$-table helps show this corresponds to $\\alpha \\approx 0.361$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, $n$ increases power by lowering the standard errors and thus making the sampling distribution for the sample mean more narrow. This is because the standard error for such a distribution is $\\text{SE} = \\frac{\\text{SD}}{\\sqrt{n}}$. With less overlapping area, greater power is achieved. \n",
